I incorporated most of my previous design into this prototype, with some minor changes. Here, I changed the position of buttons to be easier to understand, I think. Also, I changed the order of some of the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Given the software stack I used (HTML, SCSS, Javascript, jQuery), there are very few limitations. These are time tested languages that I have experience with, so the only technical limitations are few.
